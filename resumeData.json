    "bio":"ACES Coders, organized by ACES, Department of Computer Engineering, University of Peradeniya is a 12 hours continuous algorithmic programming competition. This limited-time, rapid coding competition, is one of the best platforms for the undergraduates of the country to improve their efficiency and accuracy in problem-solving, to get exposed to industry experts as well as to engage with the like-minded youth potential of the island.ACES Coders started ten years ago as a practice event to train Computer Engineering students at the University of Peradeniya to take part in similar online competitive programming competitions such as IEEEXtreme and ACM ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest).Over the past years, it has widened its goals and has become one of the most popular coding competitions among the undergraduates in Sri Lanka. Today, around 300 undergraduates from more than 20 universities and higher educational institutes of the country compete in the 12 hours overnight coding competition.This year too, ACES proudly presents ACES Coders v8.0 for all the programming passionate undergraduates all over the country. With the gained popularity over the past years, we witness an increased enthusiasm for ACES Coders v8.0 this year. Registrations are now open, so hurry up and secure your spot at the largest coding competition on the island before itâ€™s too late!!",
